# DecouKV Artifact

This repository contains the artifact for the paper **"Mitigating Resource Usage Dependency in Sorting-based KV Stores on Hybrid Storage Devices via Operation Decoupling"**, accepted at USENIX ATC '25.

## Overview

This artifact allows reviewers to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper, including:

1. DecouKV successfully improves CPU utilization compared to other systems and reduces utilization fluctuations under write-intensive workloads (Load, YCSB-A).
2. DecouKV achieves higher throughput than other systems under write-intensive workloads (Load, YCSB-A, -F); it also provides moderate improvements under read- or scan-intensive workloads (YCSB-B, -C, -D, -E).
3. DecouKV successfully reduces average latency compared to other systems under write-intensive workloads (Load, YCSB-A, -F);  it also brings slight improvements under read- or scan-intensive workloads (YCSB-B, -C, -D, -E).

Experiments are conducted on four key-value store systems, including RocksDB, MatrixKV, ADOC and DecouKV.

## Quick Start
**To Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/decoukv.git
cd decoukv
```

**To init submodules**

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
**To install packages**

```
$ sudo apt install libsnappy-dev libgflags-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libnuma-dev libstdc++-dev libpmem-dev liburing-dev
```

**To run test**
1. **Configure Fast (PMEM) and Slow (SSD) Device Paths**

Please edit the `test.sh` script before running.
Specifically, modify line 7 and 8 to set the correct paths:
    * Set `db_path` to the directory on your SSD (slow device)
    * Set `pmem_path` to the directory on your PMEM (fast device)

2. **Run all benchmarks and generate CPU utilization plots**:

```bash
nohup ./test.sh > test.log 2>&1 &
```
This will:
- Compile all four systems
- Run **Load**, **YCSB-A to F** workloads
- Output CPU utilization fluctuation plot (Figure 11) into `./test_results/`

This step may take over 24 hours to complete. You can monitor the scriptâ€™s progress in the test.log file.
Reducing the data volume (default: 100GB) can shorten the runtime, but may affect the final results.

3. **Generate throughput latency figures**:

```bash
./draw_throughput.sh   # Generates Figure 14
```

4. **Generate latency figures**:

```bash
./draw_latency.sh      # Generates Figure 13
```

To build third-party and db imples
```
$ cd third-party && ./build_third_party.sh
$ cd db_impl && ./build_db_impl.sh
```

To build YCSB-C on Ubuntu, for example:

```
$ mkdir -p build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . -j
```

To run test:

```
$ cd build && ctest
```

Run Workload A with a leveldb
implementation of the database, for example:
```
$ cd build
$ ./ycsbc -db leveldb -dbpath . -P ../workloads/workloada.spec -threads 4
```

Note that we do not have load and run commands as the original YCSB. Specify
how many records to load by the recordcount property. Reference properties
files in the workloads dir.
